A slack integration to refer people as potential new colleagues.

INTRODUCTION TO REFERRALS
80% of new hires come through Sourcing & Referrals.
For developers, this % is even higher.

A referral, is an introduction from a colleague/employee from a potential new employee, usually for a given vacancy. This is usually not a close friend, but more often a 'weak tie'. Could even be someone  you've spoken to for 15mins, but you feel the person is talented and/or a good fit.

Referrals work, because:
1/ there's a selective element (good people know good people)
2/ there's a warm introduction (definitely better than anonymous companies or horrible recruiters)

CHALLENGE
A referral should be super _easy_ to do (little time, little effort), and only works if people are regularly _reminded_ to think about potential cool people to join the company. 

Slack is a great tool to do exactly that:
1/ easy: no-login, no-interface, no learning curve, just a chatbot that asks questions
2/ reminding: new vacancies, other people referring, new team members, are all triggers that can initiate a reminder message to the entire company from referbot.
