A slack integration to refer people as potential new colleagues. <br>

INTRODUCTION TO REFERRALS <br>
80% of new hires come through Sourcing & Referrals. <br>
For developers, this % is even higher. <br>

A referral, is an introduction from a colleague/employee from a potential new employee, usually for a given vacancy. This is usually not a close friend, but more often a 'weak tie'. Could even be someone  you've spoken to for 15mins, but you feel the person is talented and/or a good fit.

Referrals work, because: <br>
1/ there's a selective element (good people know good people) <br>
2/ there's a warm introduction (definitely better than anonymous companies or horrible recruiters) <br>

CHALLENGE <br>
A referral should be super _easy_ to do (little time, little effort), and only works if people are regularly _reminded_ to think about potential cool people to join the company.  <br>

Slack is a great tool to do exactly that: <br>
1/ easy: no-login, no-interface, no learning curve, just a chatbot that asks questions <br>
2/ reminding: new vacancies, other people referring, new team members, are all triggers that can initiate a reminder message to the entire company from referbot. <br>

As an MVP, the slack integration will work with Recruitee, an Applicant Tracking System (CRM for vacancies/talent). <br>
Both LevelUp/Ihaterecruiters as well as Recruitee are in same floor in the WeWork building.<br>

it has been done before. Slack integration from another ATS (Workable) with Slack. https://blog.efounders.co/how-we-made-employee-referral-as-easy-as-a-slack-command-line-66a0ac24aad#.9k766a1d3<br>

PERSONA'S<br>
There will be different kind of users:<br>
1/ REFERRER: a referring employee, basically could be any employee / member of the slack, but it IS the one referring new talent <br>
2/ CTO: this is not the CTO per se, but it's definitely a hiring manager or recruiter. For simplicity's sake, I've thrown them together.<br>
